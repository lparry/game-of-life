Conways Game of Life
====================

Inspired today by [googles neat easter
egg](https://www.google.com/search?q=conways+game+of+life) I decided to have a
crack at writing an implementation myself. I'd previously started a few
attempts at a code retreat (45 minute iterations, then throwing out the code.
Finishing was never the point) but I've not done a complete implementation
myself.

The implementation has no fixed-size board, and allows for a world of unlimited
size (ignoring memory and processing limitations), with a view-port defined by
the printer that determines what we see. It's not particularly fast or
efficient, but it's neat to look at.
